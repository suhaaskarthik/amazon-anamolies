# Amazon anamoly detection
Uses AI algorithms that goes through satellite imagery to indicate presence of ancient civilisations

This is again a submission for a kaggle competition pls check out my writeup in kaggle, this also utilises one more satellite NASA's GEDI open-source lidar data that hasn't been published in my kaggle notebook. This is because this data had many discrepencies across the amazon regions, hence wasn't very reliable for this project

Check out my write-up on this link, where i have attached everything to this project, from the APIs used, datasets, citations and finalised error-proof notebook with the code: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-to-z-challenge/writeups/remote-sensing-for-hidden-civilizations-anomaly-de

This project uses satellite elevation data and land cover maps (Sentinel-2 WorldCover, Copernicus DEM) to detect possible ancient civilization sites hidden in the Amazon rainforest. We analyzed 33 remote regions using anomaly clustering, terrain feature extraction (elevation, slope, roughness, flatness, and peaks), and remoteness scoring to identify signs of human-made structures. Regions with elevated flat platforms, concentrated mounds, and high anomaly counts—far from modern settlements—were prioritized as top archaeological candidates for future field investigation.

This project uses satellite elevation data and land cover maps (Sentinel-2 WorldCover, Copernicus DEM) to detect possible ancient civilization sites hidden in the Amazon rainforest. We analyzed 33 remote regions using anomaly clustering, terrain feature extraction (elevation, slope, roughness, flatness, and peaks), and remoteness scoring to identify signs of human-made structures. Regions with elevated flat platforms, concentrated mounds, and high anomaly counts—far from modern settlements—were prioritized as top archaeological candidates for future field investigation.
